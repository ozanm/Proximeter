# Proximeter
This is a partner and I's project for the StuyHacks VI Hackathon. It is Proximeter, a tool for finding fun events for learning a new skill or hobby. This could influence any individual in a good way because they learn about stuff, and they become more productive, rather than just sitting on the couch.
